# -Heart-Disease-Prediction


Diseases of the heart are among the top killer diseases globally, hence the call for early predictions.
This project developed a system predicting heart disease using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). For
this, patient data was used in training a few machine-learning models such as Random Forest,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN, which ultimately
lead to the outperforming model. We further implemented a web application in Flask to further
provide ease in data entry, making predictions about the risk of heart disease to a user easier. Our
model was tested for accuracy and other performance measures, and results came pretty well. This
report describes the data preparation, model training, the development of the web app, and the
testing of the capability of this system.Diseases of the heart are among the top killer diseases globally, hence the call for early predictions.
